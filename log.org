SMS Library Work Log
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
* Issues to be delt with
** [#A] ways to fix the stoc_wave data:
*** write smsData to txt file for every frame
*** think about best way to write file, more than one malloc?
** changing the framerate in smsAnal makes deterministic component empty. huh?
** what is the difference between smsClean and the cleaning within smsAnal?
** can/is smsSynthDet be in smsSynth
** what is calcCorr in tools?
* Pre-modifications: making analysis/plotting scripts
** DONE smsToYaml for importing into python
** TODO [#C] SWIG libsms wrappers for more convenient use in python
** TODO smsPlot.py for plotting smsData over a spectrogram of audio source.
* Phase 1: Refactoring libsms for usage in real-time
** TODO [#A] switch build scripts to scons 
** TODO [#A] should have the option to store residual in audio samples or STFT frames
*** TODO organize analParams to allow for options:
   - [ ] sound samples
   - [ ] STFT frames with imag/real pairs
   - [ ] filter approximation
   - [ ] no stachostic component
*** TODO store audio data in SMS_DATA structure
    - [X] need number of samples in AllocateSmsRecord:
    - [ ] put sizeHop in AllocSmsHeader by using SMSHeader's
    framerate and samplerate
    - [X] make sure size hop shows up the same in synth and analysis,
    - [X] Q. why is SIZE_SYNTH_HOP set to 128? changing it causes memory errors..
    within AllocateSmsRecord            
         - A.  smallest size for FFT with good frequency resolution 
    - [ ] write audio data to file, check if it is the same when re-opened
    - [ ] seg fault on last frame of Stoch Analysis
         - [ ] check why there are stoch coefficients with STOC_AUDIO in sms.h         
*** TODO add print function for smsPrint
** TODO [#B] - switch to FFTW3f for fft's
** - need to configure a fftw_plan outside of process loop, and allocate buffers there
** [ ] - make sure all params are parsed correctly
**DONE check argument parsing
  - [X] stochostic type ("-e") is ignored.. NOTAPROBLEM
** TODO [#C] reorganize soundIO.  Some functions right now aren't used.. or can be combined with others
**       - what is GetResidual's WriteResidualToFile supposed to be doing?
** TODO [#C] make samplerate independant of analysis/synthesis
** DONE - reorganize tools and make with one makefile
** TODO [#B] convert README's to manpages.
** TODO [#B] make example bash scripts
** TODO [#C] move smsMod's stochostic gain adjusting to 
** TODO [#C] make options in smsAnal for output format

* Phase 2: building real-time pd externals for analysis/synthesis
** will have to normalize audio to floating point abs(1)
* Phase 3: visualizing and editing SMS data
