/*! \mainpage libsms
 *
 * libsms in an open source C library that implements SMS techniques for the analysis,
 * transformation and synthesis of musical sounds based on a sinusoidal plus residual model.
 * It is derived from the original code of Xavier Serra, as part of his PhD thesis.  You can read
 * about this and many things related to SMS at the sms homepage:
 * http://mtg.upf.edu/technologies/sms/
 *
 * Since Janurary 2008, the code Serra wrote, originally for NextStep, has undergone changes to make
 * it useful on modern day platforms.  The goal of this library is to be usable in real-time audio
 * applications for performing high-fidelity synthesis of sound models. It should work on most 
 * platforms available, although Linux is the only one tested so far. Although the code is in good working
 * order (and quite fast), the algorithms have not been looked at in many years and there is probably
 * many ways to improve them since 1991.  So, it will be an ongoing effort to improve this library in many
 * ways: optimizing, improving/verifying the algorithms, adding high-level descriptors, the list goes on and on..
 * If you would like to comment, suggest, or contribute in any way, send to the following email:

 * \section use Using libsms and the included tools
 *
 * This package not only contains a C library for SMS, but a set of tools in various forms for using the
 * library.  They are far from complete in implementation, but are in good working condition at this point.
 * 
 * The main idea behind Spectral Modeling Synthesis is that you can seperate different components of 
 * a sound that have distinctive spectral components.  These components can then be analyzed in 
 * a manner more appropriate to their characteristics. To date, there are three main components that
 * can be seperated and represented in a spectral model, 2 of which are accomplished by this library ( hopefully
 * the third will be implemented in due time):
 * - deterministic: spectra that is well modeled by evolving sinusoidal tracks
 * - stochastic: spectra that has a random phase, which is characteristic of noise.
 * - transients: spectra that begins stochastic but evolves into a deterministic signal.  This component
 *   is not yet implemented in this library, but is nonetheless important to note, as it is analyzed along with
 *   the rest of sound you are attempting to model.  
 *
 * There is much to be read at the main UPF SMS page about these components, so i won't say much 
 * more about the theory her other than the more information you know about the sound before analysis, the better.
 * 
 * In theory, the analysis is a seperate process from synthesis.  This may not be as completely necessary now that computers are fast enough to
 * perform the analysis in real-time (and there are definitally cases where this is desireable), but a good
 * analysis is hardly ever automatic.  For this reason, one may have to try several sets of parameters
 * on a given sound type before a good analysis is found.  It is also advisable to make every attempt to
 * obtain a good deterministic analysis before expecting anything decent from a stochastic model.
 *
 * sms.h has all the global declarations and needs to be included in whatever c code will use the library.
 *
 * \subsection building Building and Installing
 *
 * To build the library, a simple "scons" from the main directory should do it.  There are a few options you can see with "scons --help".
 * To install the library, type "sudo scons install", which will install the static library libsms.a, the tools, and the manpages for tools.
 * To install the python or pd components, see their sections below.
 *
 * \subsection tools Command-Line tools
 *
 * The following tools are included with the libsms package (and installed system-wide if you did a "sudo scons install").
 * Looking at their sources will give a good explanation on how to use the library.
 *
 * - smsAnal: analysis a sound file and produce a SMS model, stored in *.sms format
 * - smsSynth: synthesizes a *.sms format model.  Also does basic(time/pitch/stochastic amplitude) manipulations
 * - smsClean: clean an .sms file, scanning the entire model to connect short tracks into longer ones.
 * - smsPrint: the contents of a .sms file.
 * - smsToYaml: a .sms file to YAML text format.  In can then easily be read, or converted to other formats that understand YAML
 * - smsResample: adjust the framerate of *.sms file
 *
 * \subsection examples Examples
 *
 * In the examples folder, there are some bash scripts that show analysis and synthesis of different types of sounds.
 * The samples were downloaded from http://www.freesound.org and the url for the sample used is included with each script.  They should help
 * you get started with knowing what parameters to use for different characteristic sounds.
 * 
 * \subsection pd Externals for Pure Data (pd)
 *
 * There is a pd external library in the folder "pd" within the main libsms package.  The externals attempt to implement SMS 
 * analysis/synthesis and manipulations in a real-time, modular style that can easily be extended because they all act on.
 * a central buffer of SMS_Data.  
 *
 * Currently there are the following externals: [smsbuf], [smsanal], [smssynth~], and [smsedit].  The documentation for these 
 * externals is in the form of pd help files.
 *
 * To compile type in main directory: "scons pd". To install type: "sudo scons pd install", which will default to installing
 * the files into /usr/local/lib/pd (if your pd is somewhere else, provide the parent directory to scons with "prefix=DIR")
 *
 * \subsection python Python Module
 *
 * Although still largely untested, a SWIG interface file is in the subfolder 'python', which can be used to build python wrappers
 * with the following commands (you will of course need the SWIG developement package for system to build this):
 *
 * swig -python sms.i \n
 * python setup.py build_ext --inplace
 *
 * If everything goes well, you should have '_sms.so', which is loadable in python using "import sms".
 *
 * \section other_files Other Included Files
 *
 * There is a log at doc/log.org, within the main package.  It contains many things done, things to-do, and a wish list
 * of things that would be really nice to-do. 
 *
 * \todo tests and examples
 *
 * \section lib_structure Structure of libsms 
 *
 * Here are the main structures for analysis, synthesis, and getting from one to the other:
 *
 *  SMS_Header - information that is stored along with data, used from correctly resynthesizing. Also contains
 * space for higher-level descriptors, but they are not currently used. \n
 * SMS_AnalParams - everything to compute analysis \n
 * SMS_SynthParams - everything to compute synthesis \n
 * SMS_Data - where the analysis data ends up
 *
 * The main file for analysis routines is smsAnalysis.c. For synthesis, see smsSynthesis.c
 *
 * \subsection coding_style Info about the coding style used in this library:
 * - all functions used globally throughout the library are prepended with sms_ and are of the form
 *   sms_camelCase
 * - all data structures are prepended with SMS_ and are of the form SMS_CamelCase
 * - all global typedefs and defines are prepended with SMS_ and are capitalized
 * - there are various other static functions within the library that are not of this format, but are not
 *   meant to be used globally. Even still, there are some functions that are gobally defined that do
 *   not need to be.. but there are other fish to fry at the moment.
 *
 * \subsection terminology Terminology Used:
 * - tracks vs. trajectories: Throughout various implementations and writings on Spectral Modeling
 *   Synthesis, these two terms are used interchangeably for the partial sinusoidal components of a
 *   sound, or deterministic sinusoidal decompositinon.  In this code only the term 'track' is used for
 *   clarity and universality.
 *
 * - 'frames': the term frame is used because the data is kept in a discrete frame of time, relative to
 * the original analysis.  Of course, in synthesis it is not necessary to go frame-by-frame because
 * the synthesiser will interpolate between whatever two frames it is given in succession.
 *
 * \subsection libs Third Party Libraries Used:
 * - libsndfile: http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/ - soundfile input and output in various formats
 * - FFTW3 (floating point) http://www.fftw.org/ - an optional compilation flag allows the library to
 *   use FFTW to compute fast fourier transforms.  It is much faster, but is messy in its current 
 *  stage and the pd externals crash with it (I do not know why, other than pointers to memory
 *  are getting mixed up).
 *
 * \section doxy Generating this Documentation
 * To regenerate this documentation using doxymacs, type "scons doxygen" from the the main
 * directory. You should then get html documentation in the folder "doc/html/".
