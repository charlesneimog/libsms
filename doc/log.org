* Todo list (after 1.0)
** TODO double check smsAnal man/documentation, update smsSynth man
   - [ ] limit on nStocCoeff
** TODO double check example parameters used
** TODO fix documentation for smspd scons pd= option
** TODO SWIG / Python:
   - [ ] use Numpy SWIG typemaps for converting c arrays to numpy arrays
      - http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/SWIG_and_NumPy
      - http://matt.eifelle.com/2008/11/04/exposing-an-array-interface-with-swig-for-a-cc-structure/
** TODO remove un-updated/used tools (smsToLisp, smsSynthDet, etc)
** TODO why does yaml file show partials with negative db?!
   - see guitarchord-debugme.yaml in examples dir
** TODO add option in synthesis for transpotion while maintaing spectral shape
*** TODO need to calculate and store spectral shapes
** TODO clean/re-organize spectrum.c
   - some calles pass a null pointer to a non-existent phase spectrum
   ( because phases are not stored in the model)
   - these calls should call a different function, thereby avoiding the 
   if check for every sample
** TODO Doxygen todo list
   - pretty good for now, but many more things that could use better docs
** TODO resynthesize det+res with only 1 fft
   - in the current implementation, the stochastic and deterministic are inverse-fft'ed
     seperately
   - will need to mulitply the stochastic spectrum by the inverse blackmann harris
     window because the deterministic part uses this (see DAFX pg 36)
** TODO stochastic resynthesis needs a closer look
*** TODO always turns out louder than the original
*** TODO make sure different samplerates produce similar spectrums
    - originally the samplerate was set at 44100
    -  now it is variable
    - [ ] make plots to compare the coefficients at different samplerates
    - [ ] determine why certain constants are within StochSynthApprox (smsSynthesis.c)
*** TODO make sure nStocCoeff is set right for different framerates
    - right now, coefficients are limited to SR / FR, rounded up to the nearest pow2
    - when nCoeff is set higher than this, artifacts are appearing in the residual synthesis
    - [ ] need to check at the beginning and limit the coeffcients
** TODO Residual Resynthesis 
*** to start, just store output DFT from getResidual
      - make a check if the synthesis DFT is the same size as analysis 
      - if it is, synthesize using original phases
      - if it isn't, generate new random phases
      - from here, will have to think of how to deal with interpolation
** TODO make Post-Processing functions
*** should be included in analysis like programs
    - return a pointer to another smsData structure, or file?
*** TODO contains a smsResample 
*** TODO contains smsClean code
    - [ ] remove unused tracks
     - iterates over the entire file to connect short tracks
     - this is different than the built in cleaning in smsAnalysis because it
       already has the entire analysis
*** TODO Spectral envelope
** TODO make python synthesis script with SWIG wrappers
*** TODO even firster, redo printWindow in python
*** first start by copying smsSynth 
*** then add time-based manipulations (envelopes, pitch/time adjustments)
** TODO set of python plotting tools
    - [ ] plot waveform/spectral centroid combination
         - like freesound.org
    - [ ] use SWIG wrapper instead of yaml
** TODO re-analysis
   - the problem was SMS_ANAL_DELAY was not large enough, so not all of the
     bad frames were being re-analyzed
   - [ ] need to make this a member of SMS_AnalParams structur
** TODO make framerate of analysis specifieble by milleseconds instead of hz
** TODO [#C] optimizing
   - [ ] benchmark FFT's
   - [ ] change fabs() to fabsf() if they don't need to be doubles
     - [ ] same with floorf
   - [ ] calloc's/malloc's done per function call
   - check if they are only done once
       - most are in if statements, add an else with a print to check
   - [ ] use table lookup for dB conversion
   - [ ] currently uses random() from stdlib.
          - try merseinne twister / other generator
* Bugs
  - [ ] changing framerate in barbarie.wav (amp exam) causes seg fault
  - [ ] large analysis files
  ex. the 30 second long nightinggale sample
* Wish list
** improvement of inharmonic analysis/synthesis
   - is it being done right now?
   - in other analysis programs, one has as many as 500 partials for enharmonic sounds
   - why is smsAnal only producing < 100?
** restore Hybridize functions
*** was previously only used with the MK tool, which isn't available now
** repetive analysis using dictionary storage of params / machine learning techniques
   - can automate some parameters this way
      - window size, harmonic /inharmpic, melody/note 
** transient model synthesis
*** based on the Discrete Cosine Transform
* Things done
