* Todo list
** TODO make testing scripts
    - calls different functions with various types of soundfiles
    - either plot old and new or does a quick envelope check
    - should be short ones (fast) and long ones (robust)
    - writes output files to /tmp so things don't get cluttered
** TODO SWIG / Python:
*** TODO [#A] make it compile from main scons script
*** TODO tie soundIO functions to SMS_Sound stuct
*** TODO make a function for returning a list of SMS_Data frames
      - [ ] optional arguments to start with: start, stop frames, residual=True/False
*** TODO draw a map of where pAnalParams goes throughout sms_analysis
    - [ ] determine if it is best to pass this pointer or a pointer in the nested structure
        - ex. SMS_PeakParams or SMS_AnalParams
*** TODO find out how to access arrays in structures
    - helper functions within structure?
*** TODO find out how to add doc strings
*** TODO find out how to use exceptions
    - [ ] with functions that return an err integer, can I check this in the inlined code, then
        call an exception there? would reduce lots of python code
        - but the current error checking will not conflict with this if it is changed
          ( will just always return nothing and error checking will depend on the exceptions)
** VERIFY remove all calloc's from looping functions
   - there are many in the analysis, work on one at a time and test
   - can push them into SMS_AnalParams 
   - can do some transfers in place (waveform-> spectrum)
** DONE make function for calculating rms energy of an array
** TODO finish switch float's to sfloat's
   - so the lib can be compiled in double point precision
   - started this with sed but it missed alot
** TODO organization of main analysis routines :anal:
*** functions in analysis.c:
    - seems 4 functions will fit:
**** analyzeDet - just the sinusoids (peaks + harm detection)  of one frame
**** analyzeRes - just residual, needs analyzeDet first
**** analyzeFrame - will do the two above for one frame of data
**** analyze -  circular buffer /w adaptive window size
         - continuation done here?
         - should reAnalyze code just be in here, 
           thereby calling analyzeFrame 2x (if necessary)?
** TODO pull out fResidualPercentage into its own function
   - no reason why it should be in sms_residual if it will not be used
      - its not being used right now
** TODO convert error checking statements to use sms_error()
   - [ ] remove the SMS_ERRORS typedefs - this system if cumbersome
   - [ ] remove int returns (now can check for an error with sms_errorCheck())
** TODO documentation 
*** VERIFY double check smsAnal man/documentation, update smsSynth man
    - [ ] limit on nStocCoeff
*** VERIFY double check example parameters used
** TODO used standarzed db conversion
   - standard: db = 20*log10(x)
   - can then make a function to normalize to 0, 100, etc 
** VERIFY clean/re-organize spectrum.c
   - some calles pass a null pointer to a non-existent phase spectrum
   ( because phases are not stored in the model)
   - these calls should call a different function, thereby avoiding the 
   if check for every sample
** TODO Doxygen todo list
   - fix name changes, etc.
   - talk about sfloat in API and sms_error()
** TODO stochastic resynthesis needs a closer look :synth:
*** TODO always turns out louder than the original
    - it appears pSmsData->pFStocGain is getting multiplied through twice
    - this multiplier needs work
    - [ ] also, why is it a floating-point pointer instead of just a float?
*** TODO Hamming() is messed up,  see Bugs below
*** TODO make sure different samplerates produce similar spectrums
    - originally the samplerate was set at 44100
    -  now it is variable
    - [ ] make plots to compare the coefficients at different samplerates
    - [ ] determine why certain constants are within StochSynthApprox (smsSynthesis.c)
*** TODO make sure nStocCoeff is set right for different framerates
    - right now, coefficients are limited to SR / FR, rounded up to the nearest pow2
    - when nCoeff is set higher than this, artifacts are appearing in the residual synthesis
    - [ ] need to check at the beginning and limit the coeffcients
** TODO Residual Resynthesis
*** temp solution, just store output DFT from getResidual
      - [ ] in analysis, check if -c coeff is size power2
      - [ ] in synthesis, check if the synthesis DFT is the same size as analysis 
      - if either aren't fix it
      - for DFT, size pFStocCoeff = 2x nCoeff (real,imag pairs in sequence)
      - synthesize to waveform, then apply amplitude adjustments
      - from here, will have to think of how to deal with interpolation
** TODO harmonic Dection :anal:
     - don't think it is actually two-way mismatch
*** TODO [#A] organize so different f0 detection algos can be used
        - [ ] organize so error statistic values can be found from outside
            - can then be plotted, for comparison to other algos
*** TODO [#A] make an init function and SMS_HarmParams struct
*** TODO [#B] port TWN algo from Octave code
** TODO make Post-Processing functions :anal:
*** should be included in analysis like programs
    - return a pointer to another smsData structure, or file?
*** TODO contains a smsResample 
*** TODO contains smsClean code
    - [ ] remove unused tracks
     - iterates over the entire file to connect short tracks
     - this is different than the built in cleaning in smsAnalysis because it
       already has the entire analysis
*** TODO Spectral envelope
** TODO make python synthesis script with SWIG wrappers
*** TODO even firster, redo printWindow in python
*** first start by copying smsSynth 
*** then add time-based manipulations (envelopes, pitch/time adjustments)
** TODO set of python plotting tools
    - [ ] plot waveform/spectral centroid combination
         - like freesound.org
    - [ ] use SWIG wrapper instead of yaml
** TODO re-analysis
   - the problem was SMS_ANAL_DELAY was not large enough, so not all of the
     bad frames were being re-analyzed
   - [ ] need to make this a member of SMS_AnalParams structur
** TODO sort out track length terms 
      - some are seconds, some samples, some frames
      - [ ] make framerate of analysis specifieble by milleseconds instead of hz
** TODO optimizing
*** TODO resynthesize det+res with only 1 fft
    - in the current implementation, the stochastic and deterministic are inverse-fft'ed
      seperately
    - will need to mulitply the stochastic spectrum by the inverse blackmann harris
      window because the deterministic part uses this (see DAFX pg 36)
*** TODO change standard math routines to floating point doubles
      - should maybe wrap them in inlined function calls?
      - could move all math functions to an inlined header file
*** TODO remove all calloc's/malloc's happening per function call
         - wrap them using the static int check
*** TODO  table lookup for dB conversion
* Questions
** why is nFrames nSamples/iHopsize + 3? why + 3?
** what is the best way to convert from mag to db?
   - 0:1 -> 0:100?
   - normalize maximum to 0?
      - if this is the case, should there be a loudness measurement too?
** why not approximate residual spectrum in dB?
** Why is pre-emphasis built into sms_fillSoundBuffer?
     - is this a high-pass filter? what is this pre-emphasis / de-emphasis?
* Bugs
** Python sms_getSound() cannot load arrays 
   - [ ] first check what sizes do not load
   - [ ] then make a similar command line program to do the same, see if it crashes
         and where
** Hamming() makes the hamming window with max amplitude 0.016.
       - this should be 1.0, but if it is 1.0, then the stochastic component is waaayyyy
         too loud.
** changing framerate in barbarie.wav (amp exam) causes seg fault
** large analysis files
    - ex. the 30 second long nightinggale sample
* Wish list
** transpotion while maintaing spectral shape
** improvement of inharmonic analysis/synthesis
   - is it being done right now?
   - in other analysis programs, one has as many as 500 partials for enharmonic sounds
   - why is smsAnal only producing < 100?
** Spectral Envelope computation
   - Scharz '97
   - Discrete Cestrum analysis seems to be a good choice
   - can represent as both spectrum coefficeints and (spline) breakpoints
** multiple analyses using machine learning
** repetive analysis using dictionary storage of params / machine learning techniques
   - can automate some parameters this way
      - window size, harmonic /inharmpic, melody/note 
** make analysis macros
   - reduces the number of parameters one must set
   - will have to do an in-depth analysis of the relationship of different parameters
** transient model synthesis
*** based on the Discrete Cosine Transform
* Done list
** DONE moved synthesis buffers into pSynthParams
   - some were happening every frame
   - some weren't checking if sizeHop changed
** DONE remove un-updated/used tools (smsToLisp, smsSynthDet, etc)
** DONE fix documentation for smspd scons pd= option
** DONE deal with multi-channel soundfiles
   - channels are interleaved
   - [ ] include an integer in SMS_SoundFile for # of channels
   - [ ] include an integer in SMS_SoundFile for the channel you want (if > 1)
   - [ ] in read function, check these and only read the channel you want
