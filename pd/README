~~~~~~~~~ SMS for Puredata (Pd) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * FINISH ME
 *
 * testing the building system on other systems still.. well, actually just Mac.  Don't care about anyone else :)
 *
 *  WRITE ABOUT LIBSMS AND HOMEPAGE
 *
 * Currently there are the following externals: [smsbuf], [smsanal], [smssynth~], and [smsedit].  The documentation for these 
 * externals is in the form of pd help files.
 *
 * ---- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ----
 * To compile type in main directory: "scons". To install type: "sudo scons pd install", which will default to installing
 * the files into /usr/local/lib/pd 
 *
 * TODO: provide information about building for mac
 *
 * scons needs to know where libsms.a is, if it is not in a system wide location (like /usr/local/lib) then you can provide
 * the location by typing "scons sms=/PATH/TO/LIB". Likewise, scons also needs to know where sms.h is.  If you installed
 * libsms with default settings and a "sudo scons install", everything should be okay. 
 *
 * Of course, scons also needs to be able
 * to find the pd header (m_pd.h) as well as the following 3rd party libraries:
 * - libsndfile  ( http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/ )
 * - libpthread (standard on posix systems)
 * - libfftw (www.fftw.org) <-- this is only if you compile libsms with support for fftw (and even then it is buggy in pd)
 *
 * MAKE A COPYRIGHT NOTICE
